# uob-hep-pc072
DUNE Timing System MicroTCA Interface Board(MIB). 

Schematic capture in Cadence DE-HDL. PCB Layout in Cadence Allegro.

Schematic capture and PCB layout of the original (v1) version done at University of Pensylvania by Godwin Meyers in Cadence Orcad/Allegro

The v1 design translated to Cadence Allegro Design Entry HDL by Elgris Technologies

Changes to v1 design done by Magnus Loutit and David Cussans to produce the v2 and then v3 design

PCB layout of the v3 design done at the University of Oxford by Pete Hastings

The MIB v2 onwards has no ADN2814 CDR - recovery of clock done directly by Si5395 PLL
