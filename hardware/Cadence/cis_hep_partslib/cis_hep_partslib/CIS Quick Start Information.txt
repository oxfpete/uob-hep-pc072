What is included
-----------------------------------------------------

This installation includes setup for the database server (common place for your database) 
and the CIS clients (PC where you will be running Cadence OrCAD Capture CIS).

For the database server, the installation includes the following items:

   * MS Access database with 12 tables of parts and 1 manufacturer table
   * Technical datasheets that correspond to the parts in the database
   * Schematic Symbols for the parts in the database
   * Allegro Footprint for the parts in the database
   * .DBC configuration file
   * This file - CIS Quick Start Information.txt
   * A repather tool (Repather.exe) that will change the paths in the database for 
     the technical datasheet, thus allowing client machines to open the links.

For the CIS client, the installation includes the following setup:
   * ODBC data source creation
   * New capture.ini file with updated paths to your libraries. If a capture.ini file 
     is found during the installation process, the previous will be renamed to 
     capture_original.ini.

If both were selected, both setups have been performed.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------

- If installing this all on 1 PC, you should not need additional setup. 

- You may need to change permission or share the installation directory if a 
  database server is used.

- When using the data server, run the repather to get the links for the datasheets changed.
  Check the location of the "New Datasheet" in preview to make sure that the path is 
  accessable from another computer. If you need to change the path again, you will need to
    * Browse to the location of the CIS Quick Start Access database
    * Click test to test the connection
    * type in the path to change FROM
    * type in the New path.
   The repather can be found in the repather sub-directory of the installed directory.

-----------------------------------------------------
Making changes to install locations after install
-----------------------------------------------------

- If you want to change the install location, you can re-run the CISQuickStart installation
  to install the files to the new location and delete the previous install directory.

- If you have already started using the database and added part, you can drag and drop 
  all the installed directories and files to the new location. 

- You will need to re-run the CISQuickStart installation on all PCs that were previously
  up to use the prior location. 

-----------------------------------------------------
Viewing or Making changes to data in the database
-----------------------------------------------------

- Data can be viewed from Capture CIS or by bringing up Ms Access.  

- From CIS, you need to bring up a schematic page first. Then, right click on the sheet 
  and select "Place Database Part". The CIS Explorer tab will appear.

- Changes to the database can not be made from the CIS. Parts can be added and only as 
  TMP parts using either Derive database or ICA. Information on how this can be done is 
  located in the section "Working with database parts" in the OrcAD CIS User Guide of 
  your Cadence OrCAD installation.

- From MS Access, you can bring up the database. Part information can be viewed or
  added/modified/deleted from Access. The manufacturer information can also be viewed 
  or added/modified/deleted.
  To add a part, type in your part data directly into one of 12 tables that the part 
  belongs in. To add manufacturer parts, type the part number, the manufacturer name 
  and the manufacturer part number into the CIS Manufacturer Parts Table. Parts with 
  multiple manufacturer parts must be added on separate lines.

-----------------------------------------------------
Uninstalling CIS Quick Start
-----------------------------------------------------

- To remove the CISQuickStart files and directories, navigate to where the files have
  been installed and delete them.
